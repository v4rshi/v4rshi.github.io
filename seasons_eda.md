## **Soundtrack of Seasons**: Unraveling My Spotify Saga Over The Last 9 Years

#### Click here to see the Jupyter Notebook for [this EDA](https://github.com/v4rshi/v4rshi.github.io/blob/master/spotify_project_notebooks/seasons_eda.ipynb)!
--- 
**Project Description**: I was able to get playlist data for my Spotify playlists thanks to a website called [Exportify](https://exportify.net/). It made me wonder, can I use this data to understand my mood and well-being over the years based on the season of the year I listened to something and the sentiment of the songs (name and lyrics) themselves?

**Data**: My dataset spans from April 2016 to August 2024. Each entry contains rich metadata including artist, track, addition date, and genre. It also includes an attribute called 'Valence', which captures the sentiment of a song. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (sad, depressed, angry). Read more about it [here](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/Valence-as-a-measure-of-happiness/td-p/4385221). 

**Motivation & Hypothesis**: This dataset spans a transformative decade of my life, from college in Indiana to married life in San Francisco (and a deadly pandemic in the middle), with Spotify as my constant companion through it all. (Fun Fact: my husband and I even bonded over a Spotify '30 Songs for 30 Days' playlist challenge when we first met!)

My playlists are like musical journals, reflecting my emotions and life events. This project explores how my taste evolved and how playlist traits might correlate with my emotional state. While Spotify's "valence" is cool, I'm aiming for a more nuanced emotional map of my musical journey.

Key focus areas for this project include: 

1. Analyze musical taste evolution over time
2. Examine seasonal patterns in playlist composition
3. Perform sentiment analysis using LLM's on song lyrics, focusing on my unemployment period (July 2023-present)

By doing this analysis, I hope to reveal how my music choices reflect my life experiences and emotions. 

##### **Note: Data shows song additions, not play frequency. Play data would enable more in depth analysis of listening patterns.**

## Findings and Visualizations: 
### NOTE: Click on any graph to zoom in! 

### 1. The first thing I looked at was who my most listened-to artists were.
I was fully expecting my top artist to be Charli XCX but in a rather surprising turn of events, its Future??? I did not see this in my Future, that is for sure.

<img src="images/spotify_project/top_20_artists.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

To dig into this deeper, I looked into when I added all the songs with Future on them... to find most of it was this year. 

<img src="images/spotify_project/future_breakdown.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

Bingo! This year, Future became my top artist because 'We Don't Trust You' and 'We Still Don't Trust You,' collaborations with Metro Boomin and Future, were released. My husband and I had those albums on repeat, leading me to add many Future songs and collaborations to my playlists.

### 2. This summer is a BRAT summer for me - but historically was that always the case across my entire listening history?
Looks like spring is BRAT green! Each season is quite different, winter seemingly being all over the place since Disney, Britney Spears and BTS are all on there! 

<img src="images/spotify_project/top_10_seasonal.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

### 3. I chose to look at add number of songs over the years (by month and season) to see when I most actively added music to playlists

I wasnâ€™t surprised to see the erratic nature of my playlist curation until 2022, when I started my first full-time job. With work consuming most of my time, I wasn't curating my music as intentionally. The spike in August 2024 can be attributed to using music as a coping mechanism during a particularly stressful period.

<img src="images/spotify_project/monthly_adds_by_season.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

### 4. I tried to visualize this differently with number of songs added by season over the years.

It is clear that the pandemic in 2020 and my time being unemployed in 2024 are when I am most active. This coincides with when I was going through a lot in my personal life, too. 

<img src="images/spotify_project/monthly_song_adds_by_season_linechart.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>


### 5. I wanted to then look at song-adding volume over the seasons. I tried to visualize this differently where I normalized my data by dividing each season by no. days in a season and then dividing that by the number of years in my dataset (9 Years! Almost a third of my life!). 

This makes sense to me because I was generally most active in the winter. During college breaks and extreme weather, when I spent more time indoors, I relied on music more to pass the time.

<img src="images/spotify_project/normalized_graph_2.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

### 6. I tried visualizing seasonal distributions for various other music traits, like Danceability, Valence, Energy and Tempo, to get a general sense of what kind of music I liked in different seasons. 

This visual shows that my taste remains consistent across seasons, favoring songs that are energetic and danceable. Ya girl like music she can have a good time to! 

<img src="images/spotify_project/other_trait_distribution.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

### 7. I wanted to then look at the distributions by season and year it was added to a playlist.

I chose to pay the closest attention to 2019-2020, 2023-2024 and see how they compared to one another. The rationale is as follows:

- 2020 was the year of the pandemic, and 2019 is a baseline to compare pre and post COVID-19 music preferences
  <img src="images/spotify_project/attributes19.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>
  <img src="images/spotify_project/attributes20.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>
  
- 2023 was the year I got married but 2024 was the year I was stuck without a job in a bad market
  <img src="images/spotify_project/attributes23.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>
  <img src="images/spotify_project/attributes24.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

I did also break each year down into seasons to see any seasonal trends, but to not clutter this page with too many graphs I will summarize my observations below:

The shift in my music preferences between **2019 and 2020** shows a surprising trend towards, on average, more energetic and positive songs. While 2020 is often associated with the hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was also the year I was unexpectedly admitted to graduate school. This personal triumph, especially significant given the closed borders and uncertainty, may explain my gravitation towards upbeat music. My experience highlights how individual circumstances can contrast with broader narratives during global events. 

Between **2023 and 2024**, my music preferences show a drop, on average, in all attributes except tempo. This shift aligns with the challenges I'm facing in 2024, particularly navigating a difficult job market. The decrease in most musical attributes likely reflects my current emotional state, while the increased tempo might indicate a need for motivation or energy during these stressful times. My playlist has essentially become a reflection of my professional struggles and associated emotions. 

Note to self: Either make these playlists private or start a new career as the world's most reluctant psychic. "For just $9.99, I'll predict your future by analyzing your 'Most Played' list!" Hmm, maybe I'm onto something here...

### 8. I would be remiss to not look into Valence of songs, even though I want to do my own version of sentiment analysis in the next step of this project. 

Initially, I plotted valence over time as well as a monthly moving average to find that this graph was messy and impossible to interpret. 
<img src="images/spotify_project/valence_messy.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

Instead, I plotted a graph to analyze and visualize the average monthly valence of my Spotify playlist data over time, with annotations for significant life events.
<img src="images/spotify_project/valence_life_event.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>
Observations:
- Fluctuations in Valence: There are several sharp drops and spikes in valence, often coinciding with life events.
- Notable Drops: Significant dips in valence appear around "A Terrible Birthday," "Huge Fight with Someone Close," and "Loved One Died," suggesting these were negative experiences.
- Notable Spikes: Increases in valence are observed around events like "Reconciled with a Friend" and "Got Married," indicating these were positive experiences.
- General Trend: The valence seems to be somewhat stable but with recurrent fluctuations corresponding to life events.
- 
My music preferences clearly mirror my emotional state, suggesting a detailed sentiment analysis of song lyrics could yield fascinating insights into my specific emotions during different periods. This validation encourages a deeper exploration using sentiment analysis techniques!

### 9. I thought it would be interesting to see what my top 10 genres were by season and if they varied at all.
 In short, barely. I still am basic as hell and listen to a lot of pop, however the genres following that moved around but were only edm, hip hop, rap and/or some pop variation. What was surprising to me was the random appearance of 'Modern Rock' in the Wintertime. Wintertime House of Blues, I guess?

<img src="images/spotify_project/top_10_genres_by_season.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

I then tried to visualize this differently with a stacked bar chart and over the top 20 genres overall

<img src="images/spotify_project/top_genres_by_season_barplot.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>
This chart displays the popularity of various music genres across seasons:

- Pop is the most popular genre overall, followed by EDM and pop dance.
- Many genres, especially pop and EDM, are more popular in winter.
- Some genres like rap and hip hop show stronger popularity in summer.
- There's a wide range of genres represented, from mainstream to niche.
- Electronic and dance-oriented genres dominate the top rankings.
- All genres show some seasonal variation in popularity.
- Even less popular genres maintain a presence across all seasons, like uk dance and r&b.

I also did this by top 5 Genres over the years separated by season: 
<img src="images/spotify_project/genres_years_stacked.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>
Key points:

- Wide variety of genres represented
- Genre popularity fluctuates seasonally and yearly
- Some genres (e.g., pop, rap) appear consistently
- Summer 2017 shows highest genre diversity
- Recent years (2022-2024) have more stable genre distribution
- New genres emerge over time
- Data shown as percentages for easy comparison
- Covers 8 years, good for long-term trend analysis

### 10. I wondered, do I like current releases or nostalgic music more, and does this vary by season?
The boxplot graph below shows how my music listening habits change throughout the year. It compares the age of songs I listen to (how long ago they were released compared to when it was added to a playlist) across different seasons. The insights were very interesting. 

A primer on what a boxplot even is: it is a simple visual tool that shows the spread and symmetry of a dataset by dividing it into quartiles and highlighting key statistics like the median and potential outliers. It uses a box to represent the middle 50% of the data and lines extending from the box to show the range, making it easy to see how data is distributed. Feel free to also refer to [this guide](https://www.simplypsychology.org/boxplots.html) on how to interpret boxplots.

<img src="images/spotify_project/currentn_v_nostalgic_boxplot.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

Key findings:

- Overall trend: I typically listen to songs that are up to 10 years old, regardless of the season.
- Summer nostalgia: During summer, I tend to listen to the oldest songs compared to other seasons. This might be because summer free time makes me nostalgic for past experiences.
- Autumn freshness: In autumn, I listen to the newest music or songs I've most recently added to my playlists.
- Winter and spring: These seasons fall in between summer and autumn in terms of how old the music I listen to is.
- Occasional oldies: In all seasons, I sometimes listen to much older songs, going back 60-70 years.
- Preference for older music: Across all seasons, I tend to listen to more older songs than newer ones, but this trend is strongest in summer and weakest in autumn.

This pattern suggests that my mood and the time of year influence my music choices, with summer bringing out my most nostalgic side and autumn inspiring me to explore newer tunes.

I also broke it down by year to try and see in greater detail if this trend of listening to nostalgic music held true: 
<img src="images/spotify_project/boxplot_years.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

It is quite clear that the trend of listening to older music on average remains the same, with the exceptions of Spring 2023 and (part) of Winter 2024, where more songs were closer to the year of release than not, indicating a bias to newer releases.

### 11. I counted unique genres and did a [Pareto](https://www.cec.health.nsw.gov.au/CEC-Academy/quality-improvement-tools/pareto-charts#:~:text=The%20Pareto%20Chart%20is%20a,represented%20by%20the%20curved%20line.) analysis to see what genres of music make up most of my listening. 
For those unfamiliar with what a Pareto (also known as the 80/20 rule) suggests 80% of effects come from 20% of causes, helping people prioritize efforts on the most impactful areas. Sometimes it may not even be 80/20, but that is the ratio most commonly used. 

 I am unclear on what to glean from this for now, but it was interesting to see that nearly 50% of my music falls into just 30 genres when there are 1412 distinct ones present! The graph below just shows the top 100 genres so you cannot see the Pareto shape/tail very clearly. I realized that if I wanted to do any clustering later on, I would have to delve into this deeper.  

<img src="images/spotify_project/pareto_zoom.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

### 12. I also wanted to look at total track duration across seasons to see when I listened to longer playlists / more music by season but also by year.

Again, unsurprisingly, I had a lot of free time in the winter across all my data and in the year 2020 during the pandemic because those playlists seem to be looooong. 

<img src="images/spotify_project/total_duration_season.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>

<img src="images/spotify_project/duration_over_years.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>


### 13. Finally and what sets the stage up for the next phase of this project, which is sentiment analysis on song lyrics using LLM's, I made basic word clouds track name for each season to see what the most frequently occurring words were in song titles.

I know Spotify tracks the "Valence" of songs, but can I see what my overall mood was by looking at a word cloud of the track titles? After all, a picture is (quite literally) worth a thousand words! 

<img src="images/spotify_project/winter_wordcloud.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>
**Winter**: The winter word cloud highlights significant words like "love," "one," "night," "home," and "Christmas." It reflects winter-specific themes and emotions, balancing positive and negative feelings. Overall, it suggests winter is a mix of both holiday-related songs and introspective tunes about love and life.

<img src="images/spotify_project/spring_wordcloud.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>
**Spring**: The spring word cloud emphasizes words such as "love," "good," "feel," "summer," "new," and "sun." It shows a shift towards positivity and renewal, capturing the upbeat and fresh vibe of the spring season. Songs likely center around themes of new beginnings, happiness, and optimism.

<img src="images/spotify_project/summer_wordcloud.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>
**Summer**: The summer word cloud features words like "summer," "party," "feel," "night," "girl," "life," and "dance." It underscores the season's lively, carefree spirit, with many songs focusing on fun, adventure, and enjoying life to the fullest. The energy and enthusiasm of summer clearly shine through.

<img src="images/spotify_project/autumn_wordcloud.png?raw=true" width="1000" class="zoom" alt="Zoomable Image"/>
**Autumn**: The fall word cloud highlights words such as "love," "fall," "night," "one," "back," and "heart." Fall seems to reflect a balance of love and introspection, with songs often focusing on themes of romance, reflection, and transition. The season's contemplative nature is mirrored in the music.

### Applications of my analysis:

I can see this kind of work being useful in the mental health and wellness space. These were some ideas I had: 

1. **Identify Mood Patterns:** Correlate sentiment in song lyrics with periods of emotional change to understand how music reflects and influences mood.
2. **Enhance Therapy:** Inform music therapy by tailoring music to specific emotional needs, helping with anxiety, depression, or stress.
3. **Explore Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):** Examine seasonal patterns in music preferences to understand the impact of seasonal changes on mental health.
4. **Seasonally Tailored Playlists**: Spotify could utilize this project to recommend playlists that are tailored to users each season, based on their historical listening data and the preferences of similar users.
5. **Emotion-Based Playlists**: By analyzing a userâ€™s description of their current mood, Spotify could create highly personalized playlists that go beyond the existing "Daylist" feature, providing a more accurate reflection of the user's emotions in real time.

---

Let's examine the ethical data implications for each of these ideas:

1. **Identify Mood Patterns:**
   - Privacy concerns: Tracking users' emotional states over time could be considered invasive.
   - Data security: Emotional data is sensitive and requires robust protection.
   - Consent: Users should be fully informed about how their listening habits are being interpreted.
   - Accuracy: There's a risk of misinterpreting correlations as causation.

2. **Enhance Therapy:**
   - Medical ethics: Using AI-driven recommendations in therapy requires careful consideration and possibly regulation.
   - Liability: Who is responsible if AI-recommended music negatively affects a patient?
   - Confidentiality: Maintaining patient-therapist confidentiality while using third-party services.
   - Informed consent: Patients must understand and agree to the use of AI in their treatment.

3. **Explore Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):**
   - Potential for misdiagnosis: Music preferences alone are not sufficient to diagnose mental health conditions.
   - Data bias: Ensuring the dataset represents diverse populations and geographic locations.
   - Cultural sensitivity: Accounting for cultural differences in music preferences and SAD prevalence.

4. **Seasonally Tailored Playlists:**
   - User autonomy: Balancing personalization with user choice and discovery.
   - Transparency: Clearly communicating how and why certain music is recommended.
   - Data retention: Determining how long historical data should be kept and used.
   - Opt-out options: Allowing users to decline this feature without losing core service functionality.

5. **Emotion-Based Playlists:**
   - Emotional manipulation: Potential for influencing users' moods, which raises ethical questions.
   - Data collection: Gathering real-time emotional data requires clear user consent and robust data protection.
   - Accuracy and reliability: Ensuring the system can accurately interpret emotional states from user input.
   - Potential for misuse: Safeguarding against exploitation of users' emotional vulnerabilities.

General ethical considerations across all applications:

1. Data minimization: Collecting only necessary data to provide the service.
2. Transparency: Clearly communicating to users how their data is being used.
3. User control: Providing options for users to manage their data and preferences.
4. Algorithmic bias: Ensuring the AI doesn't perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases.
5. Accessibility: Making sure these features are available and beneficial to diverse user groups.
6. Continuous ethical review: Regularly assessing the impact and implications of these applications.
7. Collaboration with experts: Involving mental health professionals in the development and implementation of these features.

These applications have significant potential benefits, but they also come with substantial ethical responsibilities. Careful consideration, ongoing evaluation, and robust safeguards are necessary to ensure that the technology is used in a way that truly benefits users' mental health and well-being while respecting their privacy and autonomy.
